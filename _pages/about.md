I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University.](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/) As an astrophysicist, I am captivated by the cosmic journey of galaxies and how they evolve over billions of years. My research focuses on dissecting the intricate structures and star formation histories within galaxies to understand how they form, grow, and, eventually cease their star formation. My research centers on mapping these processes across cosmic time using advanced data analysis techniques and tools, including [**piXedfit**,](https://github.com/aabdurrouf/piXedfit) a software I developed for spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. Leveraging data from telescopes like **JWST**, **HST**, and **Euclid**, I explore galaxies in stunning detail, from nearby to those seen as they were in the early Universe.
